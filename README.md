I am a dedicated Software Engineer with a diverse background in UX/UI design, project management, and marketing. My passion for technology was ignited during my undergraduate studies, where I discovered the transformative power of code to create innovative solutions.

With a Bachelor of Arts in English and an MBA in Management, I bring a unique blend of creativity, leadership, and technical expertise. I am proficient in React, Vue, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, CSS Modules, and TailwindCSS for frontend development, as well as Firebase for backend authentication. Additionally, I leverage Figma to design intuitive and user-focused interfaces.
